Pair Storm is an project oriented IDE that is based on the conception of pair programming. The application contains a bunch of useful features that are going to help programmers write clear and high-quality code. Additionally, Pair Storm supply developers with different sharing features to maintain their team work even remotely. To embed these possibilities, our team has developed custom modular structure, hence Pair Storm is updates-friendly and can be easily extended. Created by Lv-425.C++ team under guidance of the SoftServe IT Academy.

Interface of Pair Storm is pretty simple. If you were using integrated development environments like Visual Studio, Qt Creator, CLion etc. before, using Pair Storm won't become a problem for you. The most used tools is always in sight. If you want to access advanced settings, simply use corresponding menus.

Pair Storm IDE has embedded chat. To make it attractive we have used frontend languages, such as QML or JS. It allows programmers to communicate during developing their products. It is based on P2P sharing conception, which allows many programmers to hang there at the same time. The IDE stores messages in the active project' database. Though, only authorized users can access project' messages.

IDE has many useful tools, which make development process easier and faster. For example, Pair Storm has embedded class generation. Thus user can easily create corresponding .h and .cpp files along with defining new methods there. 

Meanwhile, Pair Storm has a bunch of useful features that help programmer to write clean code: auto-tabulation, auto-completion, etc.

Native code editor is capable of displaying text in corresponding colors. This helps to make source code more readable and simpler for comprehension. Furthermore, internal highlighter recognizes invalid expressions. This feature significantly boosts development process, so that even not experienced programmers can easily write "compilable" code. Among all other features, editor supports line numbering, scrolling, zooming, tabbing, etc. User can open arbitrary number of code editors in split view to work with several files simultaneously. 


:heavy_plus_sign: Comments :heavy_plus_sign:

Pair Storm allows users to leave Github styled comments in the code. Commenting is significant part of the pair programming conception. All comments also get's saved in the project' database. Comments are bounded to lines of code, which means that registered user can comment out certain expressions separately.

If user wants to customize Pair Storm, we propose ready themes with predefined palettes in the settings menu. Also, for more advanced users, the one can uniformly customize IDE in conformity with his/her own wishes in the settings advanced tabs.
