Pair Storm is a project oriented integrated development environment, which based on conception of pair programming. The software contains many useful features, which aim to help programmers to write good and clearly code. About them you can read below. Also Pair Storm helps to organize coworking between two or more programmer. To reaching these goal in the program were added many modules, which help to communicate, share code etc. IDE was created by group LV-425.C++ of the SoftServe IT Academy.
